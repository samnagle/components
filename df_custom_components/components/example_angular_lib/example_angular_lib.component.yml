# This is an example of using external (CDN based) JS files following the same
#   method that Drupal core uses. The advantage to using an external file is
#   that it doesn't need to be included in the codebase, it can be loaded faster
#   from a different domain, and its easy to manage the version.
# The downside to an external JS file is that it can not be used "offline" or
#   when there isn't an internet connection.
