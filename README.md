# DF Custom Components
Provides a sample [theme repo for ACSF](https://docs.acquia.com/site-factory/theme/external/) that allows the attachment of custom components to a site factory site. This theme is a subtheme and is not necessarily intended to be used as a theme. It is simply a wrapper around the custom web components.

This relies on the [Component module](https://www.drupal.org/project/component) to easily make JS web components available inside Drupal.

## How to use this
1. Clone/fork this repo
2. Add your custom components to the "components" subfolder.
3. Connect your repo as a theme repo in ACSF (See below)
4. Enable the "DF Custom Components" theme. *DO NOT make it the default theme.*
5. Your components will now be available as blocks in the system.
